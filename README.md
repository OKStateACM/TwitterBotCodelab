# Make Your Own Twitter Bot

Welcome to this codelab! In this codelab, we're going to walk you through making your own Twitter bot.

## What is a Twitter bot?

According to Wikipedia, "A Twitter bot is a type of bot software that controls a Twitter account via the Twitter API. The bot software may autonomously perform actions such as tweeting, re-tweeting, liking, following, unfollowing, or direct messaging other accounts."

You can do a lot with Twitter bots, tweet out interesting facts, respond with a joke whenever anyone mentions a certain word, even influence people to follow your brand or vote for a particular candidate. The Twitter bot we're making is going to use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to tweet how the weather is in Stillwater whenever somebody mentions our bot in a tweet. 

## What to do now

* Install Python if you haven't already, make sure you also get pip because we will be installing some libraries.
* Make a new Twitter app using Twitter (we'll guide you through how to do this)
