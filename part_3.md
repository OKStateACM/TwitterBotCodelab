# Where to go from here

Congratulations! You've made a twitter bot! We're excited to see what you can do if you expand on this code. Here's some ideas on how to go further.

* Tweet out more details about the weather
* Get the user's location and tweet out the weather in that specific location
* Use the text in the tweet to figure out how to respond
* Use another API besides OpenWeatherMap to respond with something besides the weather

If you expand on this at all, or make your own twitter bot, make sure to share your work in our slack!
